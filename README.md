# Fourier-Analysis-in-Python
During my Signals and Systems(ECN-203) coursework I got deeply interested in Fourier Series/Transforms so I decided to dive deeper and implement various applications of it in Python as well as a FFT recursive implementation in C++.
I will be using the following packages :
+ Numpy
+ Scipy
+ Matplotlib
