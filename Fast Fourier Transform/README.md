# Fast Fourier Transform

The FFT is one of the most important algorithms in the world (right up next to Dijikstra's Shortest Path Algorithm , Binary Search etc.)
It is much faster than it's counter-part the DFT(Discrete Fourier Transform) which is a $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ complexity algorithm while the FFT has a T.C of $\mathcal{O}(n\log{}n)$
